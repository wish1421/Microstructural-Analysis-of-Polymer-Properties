## UGP Project Summary – Modeling and Simulation of Polymer Mechanical Properties

This repository contains the work completed during the UGP for the semester. The project can be broadly divided into two components:

### 1. ABAQUS Simulations

Finite element simulations were performed to study the behaviour of hyperelastic materials. Multiple loading conditions were examined, including large strain, time-dependent deformation, high strain-rate effects, and hydrostatic pressure. During the simulation phase, certain results diverged from expected trends reported in literature, which led to further investigation into potential causes of these discrepancies.

### 2. Literature Review

A detailed review of research papers on hyperelasticity was carried out to understand the mathematical models and constitutive formulations used to describe hyperelastic materials. The papers covered multiple modelling frameworks and assumptions, highlighting how material response varies depending on the scenario and loading environment.

### Key Insight

The mismatch between simulation output and published findings raised questions about the reliability and applicability of different hyperelastic models. This emphasises the importance of evaluating not only the model itself but also the conditions under which it remains valid.
